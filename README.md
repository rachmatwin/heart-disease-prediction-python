This dataset tells the characteristics of individuals who were classified as having heart disease or not using 14 variables. With a very excellent model performance based on the magnitude of the recall measure, the best model output may be utilized as a basis for detecting patients in the future, whether they are discovered to have heart disease or not. The model will be created using the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms.
